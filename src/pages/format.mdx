# ucicalendar.com Format

You can use ucicalendar.com to quickly access the current calendar or one for a specific year.

<Callout>
  When sending a link that might get referenced in the future, it's recommended
  you specify the year. However, if you're just linking to the calendar in
  general (and not referring to specific dates), specifying the year isn't
  necessary!
</Callout>

## Current / Next Calendar

`https://ucicalendar.com/` redirects to the current calendar until transcripts are available for Spring quarter (~Jun 26). Afterwards, it redirects to next year's calendar.

## Current / Next Summer Calendar

`https://ucicalendar.com/s` redirects to the current summer calendar until transcripts are available for Summer Session II (~Sep 15). Afterwards, it redirects to next year's summer calendar (if available).

## Calendar (Specific Year)

`https://ucicalendar.com/<year>` redirects to the calendar that beginning in the specified year.

For example, `https://ucicalendar.com/20` always redirects to the 2020 - 2021 academic calendar.

## Summer Calendar (Specific Year)

`https://ucicalendar.com/s<year>` redirects to the summer calendar that beginning in the specified year.

For example, `https://ucicalendar.com/s20` always redirects to the 2020 summer calendar.

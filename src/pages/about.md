# About ucicalendar.com

ucicalendar.com is a fast, and somewhat pointless, way to quickly reference the UCI academic calendar.
Instead of remembering `https://reg.uci.edu/calendars/quarterly/2022-2023/quarterly22-23.html` you can just visit `https://ucicalendar.com` to be redirected!

ucicalendar.com can also redirect you to calendars from specific years, and summer calendars! Visit [https://ucicalendar.com/format](/format) to learn more.
